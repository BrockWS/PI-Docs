Traveller's Backpack is a Minecraft mod, which adds backpacks! All the backpacks come from JavierDarkona's mod §link[https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adventure-backpack]{alt_text:"Adventure Backpack"}. Traveller's Backpack is the unofficial port of that mod for 1.12.2 

Here are some of the features :

§e- Full inventory? No more!§e
At a time where there's a lot of mods and even more items, you'll need functional and capable backpack. Since the traveller's backpack can provide about **45** inventory slots and **2** fluid tanks, which each can store up to **4** buckets of fluid or even **16** bottles of potion, this backpack becomes a really good option to consider.

§e- Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?§e
Traveller's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot) to be worn. But It doesn't mean you can wear infinite number of backpacks at the same time.

§e- The best gear for adventures!§e
What are the most important things you take with you, when you're going on an adventure? I guess it's a crafting table, bed and furnace. Now you have to take only furnace, because traveller's backpack can provide rest of the things! You are able to use crafting matrix inside of backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag in any time you want!

§e- Tons of different styles!§e
Choose your style from **75** custom backpacks and if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities (not implemented yet)!
