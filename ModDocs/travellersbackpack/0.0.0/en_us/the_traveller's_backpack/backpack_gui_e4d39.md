##### §nThe Traveller's Backpack GUI§n 

§rule{colour:0x606060,height:3,width:100%,top_pad:0}

This is the Traveller's Backpack GUI. It's relatively simple. Accessing the GUI is done by right clicking on the backpack in your hot bar, or by pressing "B" when it's on your back. This can be changed in Minecraft's own controls settings.

##### §nThe Fluid Tanks§n

The fluid tanks are on the left and right side. You can put any potion or bucket inside of these tanks. They do work with other liquids from other mods.

In order to put liquid in the tanks, simply put any liquid bucket or bottle in the bucket slot on the top. If you want to take any liquid out, put a empty bucket in the same slot. Taking liquid out with bottles do not work, no matter what liquid. You still need a bucket even if potion liquid are in the tanks.

If you ever want to dispose of liquid entirely, you can press the little "x" button next to the liquid bar.

Press that button when having the backpack in your inventory, and it will go on the players back. Backpacks can be used with armor on.

If you want to take the backpack off, press the Unequip Button.

Both of these buttons are located on the bottom left near the fluid tank.
